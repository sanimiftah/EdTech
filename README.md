## 🌱 Acknowledgments

This project is an independent initiative by [Sani Miftah](https://github.com/sanimiftah), developed independently at **Cogdev Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.**, as part of my ongoing exploration into ethical, inclusive, and context-aware applications of AI in education.  

It draws inspiration from the values of open collaboration, responsible design, and alignment with global frameworks like the **UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence**.  

At its heart, this work reflects a belief that educational technologies should empower—not overwhelm—students and teachers, especially within Southeast Asia’s diverse and multilingual learning environments.
