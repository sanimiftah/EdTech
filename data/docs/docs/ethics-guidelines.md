# 📜 Ethical Guidelines for the AI Reflection Tool

This document outlines the ethical principles guiding the development, deployment, and use of the **Ethical AI Reflection Tool for Southeast Asia Classrooms**, aligned with **UN SDG 4: Quality Education**.

---

## 🌱 1. Student Agency & Consent

- Students should know when AI tools are being used and why  
- Reflection should be self-driven, not punitive  
- Students can opt out of sharing responses for research purposes

---

## 🧠 2. Purpose-Driven AI Use

- AI detection is used to **support** learning, not to punish or police  
- The goal is to **build self-awareness and digital literacy**, not fear or shame  
- All AI scoring mechanisms must be explainable in age-appropriate language

---

## 🫂 3. Cultural Sensitivity & Local Relevance

- Prompts, feedback, and scoring logic must **respect linguistic diversity and cultural context**  
- Storytelling forms like *Leungiteun* and *sisindiran* may be integrated to foster reflection  
- Translations and local metaphors should be co-designed with teachers and students

---

## 🛡️ 4. Privacy & Data Ethics

- No personally identifiable information (PII) should be stored  
- All data is anonymized, with clear consent from participants  
- Student data will never be shared or sold  
- Educators should retain full control over data visibility and reporting

---

## 🔍 5. Transparency & Explainability

- Students and teachers should understand how AI scores (or detection labels) are generated  
- If using third-party APIs (e.g. GPTZero), explanations must be included  
- Avoid “black box” logic in sensitive decisions or flags

---

## 📈 6. Feedback, Not Surveillance

- Teachers use this tool to **guide constructive conversations**, not to accuse  
- Reflections are meant to build trust and metacognition  
- Tools should never be used for automatic grading or punishment

---

## 🌍 7. Community-Centered Design

- All updates or new features should be co-developed with classroom feedback  
- Issues of fairness, usability, and inclusivity should be raised early  
- The platform should welcome contributions from educators, students, and researchers alike
